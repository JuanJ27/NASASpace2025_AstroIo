   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**

## 🎯 Usage

### Playing the Game

1. **Enter Your Name**: When the game loads, enter your desired name (alphanumeric, max 20 characters)
2. **Start Playing**: Click "Start Game" to enter the arena
3. **Move**: Use your mouse to control your player's direction
4. **Grow**: Collect orbs (small colored circles) to increase your size
5. **Combat**: Eat players smaller than you (must be at least 10% larger)
6. **Survive**: Avoid larger players or you'll be eliminated!
7. **Win**: Become the largest player and dominate the leaderboard

### Controls
- **Mouse Movement**: Your player follows your cursor
- **Respawn**: Click "Respawn" after being eliminated
- **Instructions**: Toggle with "Show/Hide Instructions" button

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive automated test scripts:

### Basic Functionality Test
Tests connection, movement, orb eating, and name display with 3 AI players for 30 seconds.

```bash
node test-client.js
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All 3 clients initialize
- ✅ Players collect orbs and grow
- ✅ All clients survive 30 seconds
- ✅ Names display correctly

### Combat Test
Tests player vs player combat with 5 AI players (mixed strategies) for 45 seconds.

```bash
node test-combat.js
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All 5 clients initialize
- ✅ Combat occurs (players eat each other)
- ✅ Eliminations are tracked
- ✅ Winner is determined by final size

### Test Results
Both tests have been validated and pass successfully. See `test.log` for detailed results.

## 📊 Game Configuration

Server-side constants (in `server.js`):

```javascript
const GAME_CONFIG = {
  WORLD_WIDTH: 2000,           // World width in pixels
  WORLD_HEIGHT: 2000,          // World height in pixels
  NUM_ORBS: 200,               // Number of orbs in the world
  ORB_SIZE: 5,                 // Orb radius
  PLAYER_INITIAL_SIZE: 20,     // Starting player size
  MAX_PLAYERS: 5,              // Maximum simultaneous players
  TARGET_FPS: 60,              // Server update rate
  BASE_SPEED: 5,               // Base movement speed
  EAT_SIZE_MULTIPLIER: 1.1,    // Size ratio needed to eat (10% larger)
  PLAYER_GROWTH_FROM_ORB: 1,   // Size increase per orb
  PLAYER_GROWTH_FROM_PLAYER: 0.5, // Fraction of eaten player size gained
  MAX_NAME_LENGTH: 20          // Maximum characters in player name
};
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (server.js)
- **Express**: Serves static files and handles HTTP requests
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Game Loop**: Timestamp-based 60 FPS update cycle
- **State Management**: In-memory players, orbs, and game state
- **Collision Detection**: Optimized with distance pre-checks
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to console and test.log

### Frontend (index.html)
- **PixiJS**: Hardware-accelerated 2D rendering
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with server
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **CSS3**: Space-themed styling with animations
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with modal dialogs

### Network Protocol (Socket.IO Events)

**Client → Server:**
- `setName(name)`: Set player name
- `move(target)`: Update target coordinates

**Server → Client:**
- `init(data)`: Initialize player with ID and world size
- `gameState(state)`: Update with current players and orbs
- `gameOver(data)`: Notify player elimination
- `gameFull(data)`: Reject connection (max players reached)

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `public/index.html`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #8a2be2;  /* Purple */
  --bg-dark: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
  /* ... */
}
```

### Adjusting Glow Effects
Modify the glow rendering in `public/index.html`:
```javascript
function drawGlowEffect(graphics, x, y, size, color, alpha) {
  // Adjust glow radius and layers
  const glowRadius = size * 1.5;
  // ...
}
```

### World Size
Change `WORLD_WIDTH` and `WORLD_HEIGHT` in `server.js`:
```javascript
const GAME_CONFIG = {
  WORLD_WIDTH: 3000,  // Make world larger
  WORLD_HEIGHT: 3000,
  // ...
};
```

## 📈 Performance

### Server Performance
- **60 FPS Game Loop**: Consistent 16.67ms update intervals
- **Optimized Collisions**: O(n²) with distance pre-filtering
- **Memory Efficient**: In-memory state, no database overhead
- **Delta Updates**: Only transmit changes

### Client Performance
- **Hardware Acceleration**: PixiJS uses WebGL when available
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only render visible entities
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Linear interpolation for movement
- **Glow Optimization**: Cached graphics where possible

### Tested With
- ✅ 5 simultaneous players
- ✅ 200 orbs
- ✅ 60 FPS server updates
- ✅ No lag or stuttering

## 🐛 Known Issues

~~1. **NaN Coordinates**: Test scripts may log "initialized at (NaN, NaN)" briefly before first game state update. This is cosmetic and doesn't affect gameplay.~~ ✅ **FIXED** - Test scripts now initialize with placeholder coordinates.

~~2. **Player Name Display**: Names appear above players but may overlap if players are very close. This is a minor aesthetic issue.~~ ✅ **FIXED** - Names now have semi-transparent background rectangles for better visibility.

~~3. **Window Resize**: Rapid window resizing may cause brief visual glitches. Canvas adjusts automatically after resize completes.~~ ✅ **FIXED** - Window resize now debounced (100ms delay) to reduce glitches.

**Current Status**: All known issues resolved! 🎉
