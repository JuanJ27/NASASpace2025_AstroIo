## 🏆 Key Features Implemented

### Gameplay
1. **Smooth Movement**: Mouse-controlled with natural deceleration
2. **Fair Combat**: 1.1x size requirement prevents equal-size conflicts
3. **Progressive Growth**: Balance between orb and player eating
4. **Speed Scaling**: Larger players move slower (strategic depth)
5. **World Boundaries**: Players can't escape the world

### Technical
1. **60 FPS Updates**: Smooth gameplay experience
2. **Low Latency**: Optimized state transmission
3. **Concurrent Players**: Handles 5 players simultaneously
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of disconnections
5. **Memory Efficient**: No leaks detected in tests

### User Experience
1. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded players and orbs
2. **UI Information**: Real-time stats display
3. **Game Over Alert**: Clear elimination notification
4. **Camera System**: Smooth following of player
5. **Instructions**: On-screen controls guide
